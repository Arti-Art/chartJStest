# Testing Chart JS
Learning chart JS.

## Installation
use CDN JS https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js and get the chart.min script and add it to your html.

## HTML
In the html, the width and height of the canvas is a ratio.

## Example for Line Graph:
  + Line color : borderColor
  + Color for legend and each point : backgroundColor

  + beginAtZero: true will start your graph at 0. Otherwise, it will start the graph at the minimum value.

## Example for Pie Chart
  + Separate pie piece on hover: hoverOffset
